# Portfolio - Final Submission

## Introduction
This portfolio was created to showcase the skills I've learned from the courses in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. I used this assignment as an opportunity to grow my skills in Web Development, and I plan to keep working on the website in the near future to impress future employers.

## How I created my Portfolio
I created my portfolio using HTML, CSS and a small amount of Bootstrap for margin adjustments and buttons.

## What I've Learned
What can I say, I've learned a lot from making this website. At first, I struggled to make the elements of my website responsive. I further developed my skills using the flex display setting by making the website responsive on any screen size using flex-wrap. I also learned a lot about time management, too. I've always been a procrastinator, and found that working on this project I managed my time more wisely than usual.
